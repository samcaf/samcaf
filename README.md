Hi, I'm Sam Alipour-fard. I'm a graduate student at the Center for Theoretical Physics at MIT. I have a small amount of experience in particle phenomenology and am currently studying the physics of jets. I am alsot generally interested in the mathematical structure of field theory including gauge theories, solitons and instantons, supersymmetry, and classical and quantum chaos.
