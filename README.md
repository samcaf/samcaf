Hi, I'm Sam Alipour-fard. I'm a graduate student at the Center for Theoretical Physics at MIT. I have [a small amount of experience in particle phenomenology](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1729088) and am currently studying the physics of jets. I am also generally interested in the mathematical structure of field theory. I love gauge theories, solitons and instantons, supersymmetry, and am interested in learning more about classical and quantum chaos.
