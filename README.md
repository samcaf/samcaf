Hi, I'm Sam Alipour-fard. I'm a graduate student at the Center for Theoretical Physics at MIT. I study [particle physics](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1729088). I am also interested in the structure of quantum field theory. I love gauge theories, solitons and instantons, supersymmetry, and am interested in learning more about classical and quantum chaos.
